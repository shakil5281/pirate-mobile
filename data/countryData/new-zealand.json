      "question": "How do I activate a New Zealand eSIM from Pirate Mobile on my phone?",
      "answer": "After purchasing your New Zealand eSIM from Pirate Mobile, you’ll receive an email containing a QR code. To activate the eSIM, open your phone’s settings, navigate to the 'Mobile Network' or 'Cellular' section, and select 'Add eSIM' or 'Add Mobile Plan.' Use your phone’s camera to scan the QR code provided in the email. Once scanned, the eSIM will be activated within minutes, and you can start using the data immediately. If you face any issues during the activation, Pirate Mobile’s customer support team is available to assist you through the process."

    {
      "question": "Can I use the New Zealand eSIM if I am traveling through multiple regions of the country?",
      "answer": "Yes, the New Zealand eSIM from Pirate Mobile offers extensive coverage throughout the country, including major cities like Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch, as well as more remote regions. Whether you’re exploring the North Island, venturing into the South Island, or visiting smaller towns and rural areas, you can rely on the eSIM for stable mobile data connectivity. Our plans are optimized for seamless coverage across various regions, so you won’t need to worry about losing connection while you travel."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use the New Zealand eSIM alongside my regular SIM card?",
      "answer": "Yes, one of the main advantages of using an eSIM is that it can coexist with your regular SIM card. If your phone supports dual SIM functionality (most modern smartphones do), you can keep your home carrier’s physical SIM card for calls and texts while using the New Zealand eSIM for data services. This allows you to stay connected with your contacts back home while benefiting from local data rates in New Zealand. You can easily toggle between SIMs for data usage, making your travel experience more convenient."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I exceed my data limit on the New Zealand eSIM?",
      "answer": "If you exceed the data limit on your New Zealand eSIM plan, your connection may slow down or stop, depending on the specific plan you selected. However, Pirate Mobile makes it easy to top up your data. Simply visit our website, log into your account, and purchase additional data as needed. The new data will be added to your eSIM plan instantly, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity throughout your trip. We offer flexible top-up options so you can adjust your data usage on the go."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the New Zealand eSIM suitable for long-term stays or just short-term travel?",
      "answer": "Pirate Mobile offers a range of New Zealand eSIM plans that cater to both short-term travelers and individuals on extended stays. Whether you’re in New Zealand for a week or several months, you can select a plan that suits your data needs. For long-term visitors, we recommend choosing plans with larger data allowances or unlimited data options to ensure you remain connected for the duration of your stay. If your needs change during your visit, you can easily upgrade or adjust your plan without replacing the eSIM."
