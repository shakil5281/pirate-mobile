      "question": "Do I need a special device to use the Mayotte eSIM?",
      "answer": "Yes, not all devices support eSIM technology. Currently, most newer models of smartphones, such as iPhones (from iPhone XS onward), Samsung Galaxy devices (from Galaxy S20 onward), and Google Pixel devices (from Pixel 3 onward), are eSIM compatible. To check if your phone supports eSIM, go to your phone’s settings and look for 'Add Cellular Plan' or check your model’s specifications. If your phone supports eSIM, you can easily activate your Pirate Mobile eSIM for Mayotte."
