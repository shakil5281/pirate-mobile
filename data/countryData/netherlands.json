      "question": "Can I use the Netherlands eSIM if I am a tourist visiting the country for a short stay?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Pirate Mobile’s Netherlands eSIM is ideal for tourists visiting the Netherlands for short-term travel.

    {
      "question": "Is my phone compatible with a Netherlands eSIM?",
      "answer": "Most modern smartphones, including iPhones from the XS series onward, Google Pixel models, and Samsung Galaxy devices, support eSIM technology. To check if your phone is compatible, go to your phone settings, search for 'Add Mobile Plan' or 'eSIM,' and see if the option is available. If you’re unsure, you can also refer to the device compatibility list on our website or contact our customer support for assistance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use my Netherlands eSIM for voice calls and SMS, or is it data-only?",
      "answer": "While many of our Netherlands eSIM plans are primarily data-focused, certain plans may offer options for voice calls and SMS. The specifics depend on the plan you choose at purchase. For users who primarily need mobile data for browsing, social media, or navigation, data-only plans are an excellent option. However, if you need to make local or international calls, check our plan details for options that include voice and text services or consider using apps like WhatsApp, Skype, or Messenger over the internet."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I have multiple eSIMs installed on my device, including the Netherlands eSIM?",
      "answer": "Yes, many modern smartphones support multiple eSIM profiles, allowing you to store more than one eSIM on your device at a time. However, you can only activate and use one eSIM at a time. For instance, if you’re traveling across Europe and need different eSIMs for various countries, you can store them all on your device and switch between them when needed. This provides incredible flexibility, especially for frequent travelers. You can switch between active eSIMs without needing to uninstall or reinstall the profiles."
