      "question": "What are the main benefits of using a Nicaragua eSIM over a physical SIM card?",
      "answer": "A Nicaragua eSIM offers several advantages over a traditional physical SIM card. First, there’s no need to physically swap out SIM cards when you travel to different countries, meaning you can stay connected without any interruptions. With eSIM, activation is almost instant—you simply scan a QR code, and you’re ready to use mobile data or make calls. There’s also the flexibility of being able to switch between mobile networks digitally, allowing you to select the best coverage and data plans for your needs without the hassle of physically purchasing a new SIM every time. For frequent travelers or those visiting Nicaragua for a short stay, eSIM simplifies the process and keeps your main SIM functional for receiving calls or texts from home."
