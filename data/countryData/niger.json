      "question": "What exactly is an eSIM, and how does it differ from a traditional SIM card?",
      "answer": "An eSIM, or embedded SIM, is a digital version of a traditional SIM card that is embedded directly into your device. Unlike physical SIM cards, which can be removed and replaced, an eSIM allows you to switch carriers and plans without the need for a physical card. This technology simplifies the activation process, enabling users to download a mobile plan over the internet. With an eSIM, you can manage multiple mobile plans on a single device, making it particularly convenient for frequent travelers."

    {
