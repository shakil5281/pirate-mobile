      "question": "Is the Netherlands-Antilles eSIM compatible with all smartphones?",
      "answer": "While eSIM technology is supported by most newer smartphones, not all devices are compatible. The Netherlands-Antilles eSIM is compatible with popular models such as iPhones starting from the XS series, Google Pixel devices, and select Samsung Galaxy models. To check if your device supports eSIM, go to your phone's settings and look for an option to add a mobile plan or eSIM. Alternatively, you can refer to Pirate Mobile’s compatibility list on our website or reach out to our support team for assistance in determining if your device is supported."

      "question": "What data and call options are available with the Netherlands-Antilles eSIM from Pirate Mobile?",
      "answer": "Pirate Mobile offers various flexible eSIM plans for the Netherlands Antilles, tailored to suit different needs. Depending on your requirements, you can choose from data-only plans, which are perfect for travelers who primarily use the internet for browsing, social media, and GPS navigation. Some plans may also include voice calling and SMS options for those who need to make local or international calls. Before purchasing, review the available options to ensure the plan includes the services you need, whether it’s purely data or a combination of data, calls, and texts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use the Netherlands-Antilles eSIM in conjunction with my regular SIM card?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can use the Netherlands-Antilles eSIM alongside your regular physical SIM card if your phone supports dual SIM functionality. This means that you don’t have to remove your home SIM card to use the eSIM, allowing you to keep your local number active while accessing local data in the Netherlands Antilles. This is especially useful for travelers who want to continue receiving calls and texts from their home country while using data locally on the eSIM. Just ensure that your phone supports dual SIMs (both physical and eSIM) before traveling."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I lose access to my Netherlands-Antilles eSIM or need to reinstall it?",
      "answer": "If you lose access to your eSIM, for example by accidentally deleting it, you can often reinstall it by using the original QR code sent to you upon purchase. Make sure to keep the email containing the QR code handy in case you need to reactivate it. If you cannot find the QR code or encounter difficulties reinstalling the eSIM, contact Pirate Mobile’s customer support team. In most cases, we can assist you in recovering your eSIM or issuing a new QR code for reactivation. It’s a good idea to back up important information about your eSIM for future use."
