  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What is an eSIM?",
      "answer": "An eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital SIM that lets you connect to a mobile network without using a physical SIM card. You simply scan a QR code or download the eSIM profile onto your device, and you’re ready to go."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does an eSIM work?",
      "answer": "An eSIM works just like a regular SIM card, but it’s built into your phone. After you activate it, your device connects to a mobile network so you can use data, make calls (if supported), or send texts (if supported)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my phone compatible with eSIM?",
      "answer": "Most newer smartphones (like iPhones from XS and up, and many Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel, and other models) support eSIM. Check your device’s settings or the manufacturer’s website to confirm."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I have an eSIM and a physical SIM at the same time?",
      "answer": "Yes! Many phones allow dual SIM use. That means you can have a physical SIM and an eSIM active at the same time — perfect for travelers who want to keep their home number while using a local data plan."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I activate an eSIM?",
      "answer": "After you buy your eSIM, you’ll get a QR code by email. Open your phone’s settings, go to the SIM or mobile data section, and scan the QR code to install the eSIM profile."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I switch an eSIM to a different phone?",
      "answer": "Once an eSIM is installed on a device, it usually can’t be moved. You would need to get a new eSIM profile if you want to switch to another phone."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is eSIM safe to use?",
      "answer": "Yes. eSIM technology is secure. It uses encrypted profiles and connects to local networks directly, so you don’t have to worry about hidden roaming charges or data leaks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I delete my eSIM?",
      "answer": "If you delete the eSIM profile from your phone, you’ll need to contact your eSIM provider for help. In most cases, you would need to buy a new eSIM if the profile is removed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use an eSIM for calls and texts?",
      "answer": "Many eSIMs are data-only (great for using maps, apps, and the internet). If you need calls and texts, you can use apps like WhatsApp, Skype, or FaceTime. Some eSIMs do support voice and SMS, but it depends on the provider."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is eSIM installation immediate?",
      "answer": "Yes. After purchase, you receive a QR code. Scan it in your phone’s settings (e.g., Settings → Cellular → Add eSIM), and it activates right away. If you’re already in the destination country, it connects instantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use multiple eSIM plans at once?",
      "answer": "It depends on your device. Some phones allow two active eSIMs; most allow multiple stored profiles with one active at a time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I make calls and send texts with an eSIM?",
      "answer": "Most eSIMs are data-only. Use apps like WhatsApp, Skype, or FaceTime for calls and messaging. Some eSIM providers do offer voice/SMS-compatible plans, so check before purchasing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to buy a USA eSIM before traveling to the U.S.?",
      "answer": "It’s best to buy and install your eSIM a day before departure. This way, it starts working as soon as you land, so you can use maps, book rides, and browse the web without waiting in airport lines."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which devices are compatible with a USA eSIM?",
      "answer": "Most smartphones made from 2019 onward support eSIM, including newer iPhones, Samsung Galaxy, and Google Pixel models. You can check compatibility by looking for a 'DIGITAL SIM' or 'eSIM IMEI' in your device settings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use both a physical SIM and a USA eSIM simultaneously?",
      "answer": "Yes! Many phones support dual SIMs. You can keep your home number on the physical SIM while using the eSIM for U.S. mobile data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the USA eSIM support phone calls and texts?",
      "answer": "Most USA eSIM plans are data-only. You won’t get a U.S. phone number, but you can use messaging apps like WhatsApp, FaceTime, or Skype to make calls and send messages using your data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I face roaming charges with a USA eSIM?",
      "answer": "No roaming charges. A USA eSIM connects you directly to local U.S. networks as if you're permanently on one, so there’s no roaming, even though you’re a visitor."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I top up my USA eSIM once I'm in the U.S.?",
      "answer": "Most plans are prepaid and can't be reloaded. However, some providers do offer top-ups or additional packages if you need more data during your stay—check before you buy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I do if my USA eSIM doesn't activate?",
      "answer": "Make sure your device is unlocked and that Mobile Data and Data Roaming are enabled in settings. If it still doesn’t work, restart your phone or download the APN settings manually. For further help, contact your eSIM provider’s support team."
    },
    {
      "question": "When does my USA eSIM plan start working?",
      "answer": "Generally, eSIM plans start as soon as you activate them. However, check your provider’s policy; some start work upon installation, while others begin when you first connect to the local network."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are USA eSIMs secure?",
      "answer": "Yes. eSIMs are encrypted and embedded in your device, making them harder to tamper with than physical SIM cards. They also help you avoid sharing personal data at local kiosks or stores."
