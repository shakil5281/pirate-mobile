    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is an eSIM?",
        "answer": "An eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital SIM that lets you connect to a mobile network without using a physical SIM card. You simply scan a QR code or download the eSIM profile onto your device, and you’re ready to go."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does an eSIM work?",
        "answer": "An eSIM works just like a regular SIM card, but it’s built into your phone. After you activate it, your device connects to a mobile network so you can use data, make calls (if supported), or send texts (if supported)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my phone compatible with eSIM?",
        "answer": "Most newer smartphones (like iPhones from XS and up, and many Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel, and other models) support eSIM. Check your device’s settings or the manufacturer’s website to confirm."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I have an eSIM and a physical SIM at the same time?",
        "answer": "Yes! Many phones allow dual SIM use. That means you can have a physical SIM and an eSIM active at the same time — perfect for travelers who want to keep their home number while using a local data plan."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I activate an eSIM?",
        "answer": "After you buy your eSIM, you’ll get a QR code by email. Open your phone’s settings, go to the SIM or mobile data section, and scan the QR code to install the eSIM profile."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I switch an eSIM to a different phone?",
        "answer": "Once an eSIM is installed on a device, it usually can’t be moved. You would need to get a new eSIM profile if you want to switch to another phone."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is eSIM safe to use?",
        "answer": "Yes. eSIM technology is secure. It uses encrypted profiles and connects to local networks directly, so you don’t have to worry about hidden roaming charges or data leaks."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I delete my eSIM?",
        "answer": "If you delete the eSIM profile from your phone, you’ll need to contact your eSIM provider for help. In most cases, you would need to buy a new eSIM if the profile is removed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use an eSIM for calls and texts?",
        "answer": "Many eSIMs are data-only (great for using maps, apps, and the internet). If you need calls and texts, you can use apps like WhatsApp, Skype, or FaceTime. Some eSIMs do support voice and SMS, but it depends on the provider."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is eSIM installation immediate?",
        "answer": "Yes. After purchase, you receive a QR code. Scan it in your phone’s settings (e.g., Settings → Cellular → Add eSIM), and it activates right away. If you’re already in the destination country, it connects instantly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use multiple eSIM plans at once?",
        "answer": "It depends on your device. Some phones allow two active eSIMs; most allow multiple stored profiles with one active at a time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I make calls and send texts with an eSIM?",
        "answer": "Most eSIMs are data-only. Use apps like WhatsApp, Skype, or FaceTime for calls and messaging. Some eSIM providers do offer voice/SMS-compatible plans, so check before purchasing."
